          <h2>Solar Systems</h2>
          <p>
            A solar system consists of a star and all the objects that are bound
            to it by gravity, including planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and
            meteoroids. Our solar system, with the Sun at its center, is just
            one of many in the universe. There are various types of solar
            systems, each with different arrangements and characteristics of
            celestial bodies.
